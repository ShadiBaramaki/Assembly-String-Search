# MASM String Processing: Reverse & Substring Search

##  Overview  
This project is an x86 MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) program that performs essential string operations using DOS interrupt services. The program:  
- Reverses a user-input string  
- Searches for occurrences of a substring within a main string  
- Displays the original string, substring, match count, match positions, and the reversed string  

This program is useful for learning low-level string manipulation, working with registers, and handling user input in assembly language.

## ⚙️ Features  
✅ Accepts user input for a **main string** and a **substring**  
✅ **Reverses** the main string and displays the result  
✅ **Finds and counts** all occurrences of the substring  
✅ Displays:  
   - **Original main string**  
   - **Entered substring**  
   - **Number of matches**  
   - **Match positions**  
   - **Reversed main string**
